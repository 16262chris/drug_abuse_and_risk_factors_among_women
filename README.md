# Drug Abuse and Risk Factors Among Women 

## Description:
This project investigates drug abuse and its associated risk factors among women. Using Python libraries and guided by data science principles, the project explores the relationships between demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, and substance use patterns among women. A Gradient Boosting Classifier is then used to train the predictive model.

## Technologies:
Python <br>
Pandas - data manipulation <br>
Matplotlib, Seaborn - visualization <br>
Scikit-learn - machine learning

## Dataset:
This dataset was obtained by filtering female records from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle:
